Few Thoughts...Why am I doing this?
This is a first step to organize everything.
Too many things are going on in my life.
So I am going to start managing things by automating little things.

How am I building this website? I used

https://www.colorhexa.com/
https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/build-static-sveltekit-markdown-blog
and of course ChatGPT

From now on I plan on optimizing many aspects of my life using

Reaper, Ableton for music production
Rust, mojo, Svelte
Neovim, Zellij, and Alacritty

Feel free to come by any time, Occassionally I will have something written/updated
