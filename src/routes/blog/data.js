			'<p>There are so many ideas that comes and goes. In 2023 I tried to keep everything in my personal journal. However, starting from this year. I hope to share part of my thoughts. This website will always be an on-going progress, so feel free to come by and check the progress. Maybe I might post something interesting about music, programming or random things.</p><p>Time to time, I might add some few tools for myself, maybe this might be something for you as well.</p><p>This website is influenced by Matt Fantinel, https://fantinel.dev/</p> <p>First I wanted to use his template but I realized that I might as well learn everything from scratch, to add more details in the future</p><p>I am using Svelte, Sveltekit, MeltUI and of course a lot of ChatGPT</p>'
